### What's the problem?
Most people rely on alarms to wake them up. Travellers rely on google map to catch the train or bus to their destination and workers check google map to know the fastest and the cheapest route to and from work during rush hours. Most often when the phone alarm rings, people are in a hurry to prepare and go to work and in so doing forget to check the weather for the day. This sometimes results in people facing dangerious and severe weather outside(heat index, wind chill, lightening, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes) which affect people with allergies, asthma, and heat stress. 
Since the weather sometimes changes suddenly, drivers are faced with unexpected dangerious weather conditions that can result in accident and death.  This affect the family of the driver since he or she is the breadwinner. It affects the company's target, reduces profit, and breaks supply chain which affects everybody.  


### How can technology help?

* Real-time weather monitoring (*voice prompt and visual*).
* Suggesting the nearest parking area.

Getting a voice prompt and visuals of the weather for the day after your alarm rings on your phone and checking the fastest route to work on google map, will go a long way to save lives and property. Having a weather app in your car that predicts an incoming typhoon or sudden strong wind and suggest a nearby parking area will save drivers, their family, and company.

IGou will be built using a dataset from NOAA (ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo.web/search). IGou model will be tried on RNN, CNN, and GRU. IBM WATSON RStudio technology may be used. 


## The idea 
IGou app will send a weather voice prompt with visuals to the user after the user has click on snooze or stop button when the phone alarm rings or when the user checks map for his or destination. IGou will suggest a nearby parking area to drivers when there is an incoming strong wind.

## How it will work
##Wake up
Install IGou and enter your name
The user will input the time he or she wants to wake up.
when the phone alarm rings the user will have to press either the snooze or stop button.
IGou will send a voice promt with visuals. Eg, " Hello, 'name of the user', It will be hot today. Don't foget to take an umbrella, sun cream and remain hydrated. Good luck"

##Checking for a destination
Install IGou and enter your name
Use google map to search for your location
IGou waits for 20 seconds and sends a voice promt. Eg, "Hey! It will be rainy in 'name of destination'. Don't forget to take your raincoat or umbrella. stay safe"
